# 🌐 My Portfolio Website

This is my personal developer portfolio website built with **React.js**, showcasing my projects, skills, and ways to get in touch. The design is clean, responsive, and dynamic — with smooth animations and interaction effects powered by **Framer Motion**. It also includes a working contact form using **Formspree** for real-time feedback and email submissions.
